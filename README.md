# Hey, I'm Jishnu 👋

Software engineer based in Chicago. Graduated from Illinois Institute of Technology with a BS in Computer Engineering (Dec 2025).

I mostly work on full-stack web apps with React and AWS — been really into serverless lately. Also dabble in embedded systems when I get the chance.

## What I've been working on

**[SneakersForLess](https://sneakersforless.org)** — price comparison site for sneakers. React frontend, Lambda + DynamoDB backend, deployed on CloudFront. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions, which made deployments way less painful.

**[Old Is Gold](https://oldisgold.fit)** — fitness app designed for seniors. Nutrition tracking, workout recommendations, progress analytics. Same serverless stack, sub-200ms response times.

**Think Fast!** — trivia game I built with a team of 4 using Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Physical buttons, LED feedback, the whole thing. Was a fun change from web dev.

## Tech I use

JavaScript, Python, Java, C, C++, React, Node.js, AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront, EC2), Docker, Git, OpenMP, Linux/Ubuntu
